# üè∑Ô∏è Classification from Scratch

This project demonstrates how a **Classification Model** works by implementing it from scratch in Python using only basic libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib, as well as using Scikit-Learn for comparison.  
It focuses on understanding the core concepts of supervised classification, decision boundaries, and accuracy evaluation.

## üß† What I Learned

- How classification differs from regression  
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling for classification tasks  
- Implementing decision rules for classification  
- Visualizing decision boundaries in 2D  
- Evaluating performance using accuracy

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Data Preparation** ‚Äì Load dataset, preprocess, and split into train/test sets  
2. **Model Training** ‚Äì Fit the classification model (from scratch and via Scikit-Learn)  
3. **Prediction** ‚Äì Predict classes for new data points  
4. **Evaluation** ‚Äì Measure accuracy and visualize results  
5. **Visualization** ‚Äì Plot decision boundaries and class separation
