# 🧠 Machine Learning Journey – From Scratch to Advanced 🚀

Welcome to my Machine Learning portfolio!  
This repository is a collection of ML Learnings I've implemented from **scratch** using Python and gradually enhanced using **popular libraries** like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.

Each project reflects a key concept I've learned, implemented, and documented.

## 📚 Project List

| #  | Project Name | Description |
|----|--------------|-------------|
| 1  | Linear Regression | Implemented linear regression using gradient descent and plotted best-fit line manually. |
| 2  | Polynomial Regression | Implemented polynomial regression using gradient descent with multiple features and plotted best-fit line manually. |
| 3  | Logistic Regression | Implemented logistic regression using gradient descent and plotted best-fit line manually. |
| 4  | Classification | Implemented Classification algorithm using basic Neural Networks and measures to avoid overfitting. |

## 📌 How to Use

Each folder contains:
- 📄 `README.md` explaining the concept and approach
- 🧠 `.ipynb` / `.py` file with implementation
- 📊 Sample plots or outputs

You can run `.ipynb` notebooks in Jupyter or Google Colab.
