# 🧠 Machine Learning Journey – From Scratch to Advanced 🚀

Welcome to my Machine Learning portfolio!  
This repository is a collection of ML Learnings I've implemented from **scratch** using Python and gradually enhanced using **popular libraries** like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.

Each project reflects a key concept I've learned, implemented, and documented.

## 📌 How to Use

Each folder contains:
- 📄 `README.md` explaining the concept and approach
- 🧠 `.ipynb` / `.py` file with implementation
- 📊 Sample plots or outputs

You can run `.ipynb` notebooks in Jupyter or Google Colab.
